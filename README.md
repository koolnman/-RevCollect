Markets Revenue Collection Management  System

A blockchain-based fintech solution for the Lusaka City Council, built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).

Overview

EasyTech Business Solutions Limited is a Zambian startup proposing a secure, transparent, and efficient Revenue Collection System to replace the current manual levy collection used by the Lusaka City Council.

The Problem

The existing manual system suffers from a lack of transparency due to paper-based receipts, operational inefficiency from daily cash collections, security risks associated with cash handling, and wasteful resource consumption.

The Solution

Our multi-phase system leverages the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) —a secure, scalable, and decentralized blockchain platform—to create an immutable record of all transactions. This enhances trust, auditability, and data integrity. The platform is developed using the Motoko programming language to ensure secure and efficient Web3 smart contracts.

Phase 1: Marketers' Revenue System

This initial phase targets vendors in Lusaka’s major markets. Key features include:

· Vendor Registration: Marketers, retail shops, and wholesalers register on the platform.
· Digital Levy Payment: Vendors pay levies securely via mobile money or other digital options.
· Automated Receipts: Tamper-proof digital receipts are generated and stored on the blockchain.
· Real-Time Reporting: The council gains instant insights into collection data and market activity.

Project Roadmap

· Phase 1 (3 Months): Develop core functionality (registration, payments) and launch a pilot at Lusaka’s City Market and bus station. This includes payment gateway integration, user training, and system launch.
· Phase 2 (3 Months): Expand coverage to include retail shops, wholesales, and buses in markets such as Soweto, Green, and Comesa, and bus stations like Kulima Tower and Intercity.
· Phase 3 (3 Months): Integrate with existing council systems, launch a mobile app for vendors, and include additional revenue streams (e.g., toilet fees).

The Team

Our team possesses expertise in Blockchain Technology, AI, Mobile App Development, Secure Coding (Motoko), and Business Development.

Sustainability & Next Steps

Long-term sustainability will be achieved via a minimal and transparent transaction fee model. A detailed budget is available upon request. We are seeking grant funding to cover development and initial implementation costs.

This project aims to revolutionize public sector revenue collection by reducing costs, improving transparency, and paving the way for broader blockchain adoption in Zambia.
